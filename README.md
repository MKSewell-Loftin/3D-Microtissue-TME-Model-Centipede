# 3D-Microtissue-TME-Model-Centipede
This repository contains files related to the generation and use of the microfluidic device as desribed in the Sewell-Loftin et al. _lab on a Chip  paper from 2020. 
The CAD file is the design that can be printed via soft lithography techniques. 
The Loading protocol describes how to add cells embedded in matrix to the systems. There are also additional instructions for how to add/load media to create specific feeding regimes.
